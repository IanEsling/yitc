            <p>Yoga is a system of education that imparts the secrets of controlling the complex energy fields of the
                human form.
                Through the dissolving and merging of these opposing energies into one whole, the body is made fit for
                the journey of life.
                It is not a fancy exercise programme dressed in spiritual clothes, as many of its present day
                practitioners view it.
                Yoga is a spiritual science of practical living. It is imparted by teachers who have encountered this
                wisdom.
                Their love of this knowledge provides the spark that lights the torch of wisdom for the student.</p>

            <p>The mastery of yoga has always been achieved through the combination of three sciences. From the
                knowledge of Marma sthana
                (the 108 vital points of the body), one gains control over the bodily functions through the practice of
                asanas (bodily positions).
                Mastery of the science of Nadis (subtle channels) gives rise to inner light through the practice of
                pranayama (breath control).
                The science of Vayus (internal currents of wind) enables the practitioner to hear the quiet whispers
                from within that teach the secret
                names of the one who is the source and support of everything in this world.</p>

            <p>These three sciences have, since time immemorial, been revealed to students through a series of
                uncomplicated body movements.
                Their simplicity allows the natural responses of the body's hidden intelligence to surface without the
                excitement triggered by
                excessive muscular effort. Excessive muscular action induces vata (disturbed wind), a condition that
                manifests as structural and
                psycho-emotional instability. This leads to kapha (mucus) which causes heaviness and depression. This in
                turn will disturb the
                element of fire, giving rise to obsessive and ultimately destructive behaviour.</p>

            <p>Unless the sciences of marmas, nadis and vayus have been communicated well by the teacher and correctly
                applied, the student will
                start off in the wrong direction and move inexorably towards a state of profound disharmony. The outcome
                of correct practice is harmony,
                which is the true state of wisdom called Yoga.</p>

            <p>The teacher only exists to prepare the student so that the steady light of the student's own wisdom will
                illuminate his own path.
                There are no guides to the path of life and the same path can never be walked twice since it is personal
                and unique. The laws of this
                journey are that each step is unrepeatable and unforeseen. One has no option but to respond to the
                demands of this real adventure.
                Everything is constantly moving and changing as one stage dissolves into the next to reveal new
                configurations, climates and landscapes.</p>
